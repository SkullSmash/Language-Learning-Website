        <p>There are multiple types of Nouns</p>
        <p>Different types of nouns<p>
          <ol><li><pre> Common nouns
          Common nouns are words that refer to undefined or generic people, places, or things.For example, the country is a common
          noun that refers to a generic place while the word Canada is not a common noun because it refers to a specific place.
          Common nouns are only capitalized when they begin sentences or are used in the names or titles of something, as in
          Grand Canyon or Iron Man.
          
          Common nouns:
          house, cat, girl, foot, country</pre></li>

          <li><pre>  Proper nouns
          Proper nouns help distinguish a specific person, place, or thing. These words should be capitalized. The names and titles
          of things are always proper nouns, such as the brand name Starbucks and the personal name Jenny. 
          
          Proper nouns:
          Spain, Fido, Sony</pre></li> 
          
          <li><pre>Singular nouns
          Singular nouns are nouns that refer to only one person, place or thing. For example, a cat is one animal and a banana is one
          fruit.
          
          Singular nouns:
          house, cat, girl, foot, country</pre></li> 
          <li><pre> Plural nouns
          A plural noun refers to more than one of something. Many singular nouns just need an S added at the end to make them plural
          (e.g., bee becomes bees). For some nouns that already end with an S, you may need to add -es to the end to make their\
          plural forms (e.g., classes and buses). Some singular nouns also change spelling when made plural (e.g. countries and babies).
          Regular plural nouns:
          houses, cats, girls, countries
          Not all nouns follow this pattern. Those that become plural in other ways are called irregular plural nouns.
          Some examples are man and men, wolf and wolves, foot and feet, and sheep and … sheep.
          
          Irregular plural nouns:
          person and people
          life and lives
          mouse and mice
          tooth and teeth</pre></li> 
          <li><pre>Concrete nouns
          A concrete noun is something that can be perceived through the five senses. If you can see, hear, touch, taste, or smell something,
          it uses a concrete noun.
          
          Concrete nouns:
          table, apple, rabbit, ear</pre></li>
          
          <li><pre>Abstract nouns
          Abstract nouns are intangible ideas that can’t be perceived with the five senses, such as social concepts, political theories,
          and character traits. For example, the abstract noun anger refers to an emotion and the abstract noun courage refers to a quality
          a person has.
          
          Abstract nouns:
          love, creativity, democracy</pre></li>
          
          <li><pre>Collective nouns
          A collective noun is a noun that functions as a singular noun while referring to a group of people or things. A collective noun refers to a
           group that functions as one unit or performs the same action at the same time. For example: the team plays in the main gym.
          
          collective nouns:
          crowd, flocks, committee, a sum of money</pre></li>
          
          <li><pre>Compound nouns
           A compound noun combines two or more words into one. Compound nouns can appear as a single word, multiple words used separately, or words connected by hyphens.

          compound nouns:
          dry-cleaning, jack-in-the-box, toothpaste, haircut, output, ice cream, potato chip</pre></li>
          
          <li><pre>Countable nouns
          A countable noun (also known as a count noun) is one that you can count. When you have three books or 10 pennies, 
          you are describing a noun that is countable.

          countable nouns:
          table, apple, rabbit, ear</pre></li>
          <li><pre> Uncountable nouns
          An uncountable noun (also known as a mass noun) is one that cannot be counted. For example, happiness cannot be counted.
           You don’t say that you have “a happiness” or “three happinesses.” Uncountable nouns typically don’t have plural forms.

          uncountable nouns:
          salt, seafood, luggage, advice</pre></li></ol>
