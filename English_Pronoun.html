        <p>What Is a Pronoun?
          A pronoun is used in the place of a noun. It substitutes the noun in a paragraph or piece of writing to avoid repetition of the noun. Pronouns can be used in singular and plural forms. The verb used in the sentence should be used in accordance with the particular form of the pronoun used.
          
          Pronouns are generally classified into three main kinds.</p>

          <h2>Definition of a Pronoun</h2>
          <p>A pronoun is defined as a word that is used instead of a noun or a noun phrase, according to the Cambridge Dictionary. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines pronouns as ‘any of a small set of words (such as I, she, he, you, it, we, or they) in a language that are used as substitutes for nouns or noun phrases and whose referents are named or understood in the context’. According to the Collins Dictionary, ‘A pronoun is a word that you use to refer to someone or something when you do not need to use a noun, often because the person or thing has been mentioned earlier. Examples are ‘it’, ‘she’, ‘something’, and ‘myself’.’
