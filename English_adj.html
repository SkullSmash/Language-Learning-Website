        <h1>What is an adjective?</h1>
<p>An adjective is a word that modifies a noun or a pronoun.
 In general, adjectives usually give us more information about a noun or pronoun by describing it 
 or providing more information about it. For example, the adjective funny is used to say something
  causes fun or laughter.</p>
<p>We are going to look at types of adjectives that we commonly use in everyday writing and speech. Before we do,
     though, there are a couple things we need to address first.</p>
    <ol>
